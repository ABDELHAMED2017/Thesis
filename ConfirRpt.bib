  abstract = {The dynamic power consumed by a digital CMOS circuit is directly proportional
	to both switching activity and interconnect capacitance. In this
	paper, we consider early prediction of net activity and interconnect
	capacitance in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) designs. We develop
	empirical prediction models for these parameters, suitable for use
	in power-aware layout synthesis, early power estimation/planning,
	and other applications. We examine how switching activity on a net
	changes when delays are zero (zero delay activity) versus when logic
	delays are considered (logic delay activity) versus when both logic
	and routing delays are considered (routed delay activity). We then
	describe a novel approach for prelayout activity prediction that
	estimates a net's routed delay activity using only zero or logic
	delay activity values, along with structural and functional circuit
	properties. For capacitance prediction, we show that prediction accuracy
	is improved by considering aspects of the FPGA interconnect architecture
	in addition to generic parameters, such as net fanout and bounding
	box perimeter length. We also demonstrate that there is an inherent
	variability (noise) in the switching activity and capacitance of
	nets that limits the accuracy attainable in prediction. Experimental
	results show the proposed prediction models work well given the noise
	limitations.},

  abstract = {Application studies in the areas of image- and video-processing indicate
	that between 50%-80% of the power cost in these systems is due to
	data storage and transfers. This is especially true for multiprocessor
	realizations because conventional parallelization methods ignore
	the power cost and focus only on performance. However, the power
	consumption also heavily depends on the way a system is parallelized.
	To reduce this dominant cost, we propose to address the system-level
	storage organization for the multidimensional signals as a first
	step in mapping these applications, before the parallelization or
	partitioning decisions (in particular, before the hardware/software
	(HW/SW) partitioning, which is traditionally done too early in the
	design trajectory). Our methodology is illustrated on a parallel
	quadtree-structured difference pulse-code modulation video codec},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of joint symbol timing and carrier-frequency
	offset (CFO) estimation in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
	(OFDM) systems with noncircular (NC) transmissions. Maximum-likelihood
	(ML) estimators of symbol timing and CFO have been derived under
	the assumption of nondispersive channel and by modeling the OFDM
	signal vector as a circular complex Gaussian random vector (C-CGRV).
	The Gaussian assumption is reasonable when the number of subcarriers
	is sufficiently large. However, if the data symbols belong to an
	NC constellation, the received signal vector becomes an NC-CGRV,
	i.e., a CGRV whose relation matrix (defined as the statistical expectation
	of the product between the vector and its transpose) is not identically
	zero. Hence, in this case, previously mentioned estimators, termed
	MLC estimators, are not ML estimators. In this paper, by exploiting
	the joint probability density function for NC-CGRVs, ML estimators
	are derived. Moreover, since their implementation complexity is high,
	feasible computational algorithms are considered. Finally, refined
	symbol timing estimators, apt to counteract the degrading effects
	of intersymbol interference (ISI) in dispersive channels, are suggested.
	The performance of the derived estimators is assessed via computer
	simulation and compared with that of MLC estimators and that of modified
	MLC (MMLC) estimators exploiting only ISI-free samples of the cyclic
	prefix},

	parameters, including the fast Fourier transform size and the single-input/single-output
	as well as multiple-input/single-output mode, to appropriately configure
	the receiver for carrying out the subsequent processing. In this
	paper, an improved preamble design is proposed, where a pair of training
	sequences is inserted in the frequency domain, and their distance
	is used for transmission parameter signaling. At the receiver, only
	a low-complexity correlator is required for the detection of the
	signaling. Both the coarse carrier frequency offset and the signaling
	can simultaneously be estimated by detecting the aforementioned correlation.
	Compared with the standardized P1 symbol, the proposed preamble design
	significantly reduces the complexity of the receiver while retaining
	high robustness in frequency-selective fading channels. Furthermore,
	we demonstrate that the proposed preamble design achieves better
	signaling performance than the standardized P1 symbol despite reducing
	the numbers of multiplications and additions by about 40% and 20%,

	can efficiently provide stable end-to-end transmissions over DSA
	links, given their dynamic and unpredictable nature, remained unclear.
	Therefore, we have studied by simulation the ability of various TCP
	flavors to efficiently utilize DSA links. We have performed simulations
	using the TCP stack from the Linux operating system. Our simulations
	show that modern TCPs can efficiently make use of the dynamic capacity
	of DSA links for bulk data transmission, under a wide range of conditions,
	but only if certain requirements are met. We also analytically determine
	the effect of Primary User (PU) detection errors on TCP performance

	reduction in a DSA environment is the observation time, not, as one
	might expect, PU detection errors.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme using a new single-symbol
	preamble structure for OFDM data-aided synchronization. The preamble
	symbol is constituted of two successive equal-duration sub-symbols,
	the second one of which is a differentially encoded version of the
	first one, using an adequately designed precoding sequence. This
	structure leads to almost perfect channel autocorrelation profile
	with sharp in-phase peak and zero out-of-phase correlation. For comparison,
	we review some previous methods also based on data-aided synchronization
	for OFDM systems. We here explore the performance of the new method
	in the case of the AWGN channel. The performance is presented in
	terms of correct frame start detection rate and estimator's variance
	for time estimation. For fractional frequency offset estimation,
	the performance is evaluated in terms of mean squared error. The
	obtained results prove that the accuracy of the frame start detection
	and the fractional frequency offset estimation are greatly enhanced,
	even at very low SNRs. We show that compared to the best benchmark,
	gains of about 5 dB and 20 dB are achieved for timing precision of
	one sample and of one tenth of a sample, respectively. We also show
	that for a target correct detection rate of 95%, our approach provides
	more than 17 dB gain with respect to the best benchmark. Although
	we concentrate here on OFDM, the proposed approach can be applied
	to other systems such as TDMA or CDMA.},

	and power consumption at the register-transfer level (RTL), using
	a combination of macro-modeling for datapath blocks, and control
	logic analysis techniques based on partial delay information. Previous
	work on estimating switching activity and power at the RTL has ignored
	the presence of glitches at various datapath and control signals.
	We demonstrate that glitches can form a significant component of
	the switching activity at signals in typical RTL circuits. In particular,
	for control-flow intensive designs, we show that the controller substantially
	affects the activity and power consumption in the datapath due to
	the presence of glitches at control signals. Since the final implementation
	of the controller is not available during high-level design iterations,
	we develop techniques that estimate glitching activity at control
	signals using control expressions and partial delay information.
	For datapath blocks that operate on word-level data, we construct
	piecewise linear models that capture the variation of output glitching
	activity and power consumption with various word-level parameters
	like mean, standard deviation, spatial and temporal correlations,
	and glitching activity at the block's inputs. For RTL blocks that
	operate on bit vectors that need not have an associated word-level
	value, we present accurate bit-level modeling techniques for glitching
	activity as well as power consumption. This allows us to perform
	accurate power estimation for control-flow intensive circuits, where
	most of the power consumed is dissipated in non-arithmetic components
	like multiplexers, registers, vector logic operators, etc. Experimental
	results on several RTL designs demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed
	estimation techniques. Our RTL power estimator produced estimates
	that were within 7% of those produced by an in-house power analysis
	tool on the final gate-level implementation, while being over 50
	times; faster than its gate-level counterpart.},

	symbols can be improved to a level that the fine frequency synchronization
	process using long training symbols in the conventional scheme would
	not be needed. Thus both timing and frequency synchronization can
	be achieved using short training symbols alone to reduce computational
	complexity and overhead. Furthermore, the hardware architecture of
	the proposed synchronization scheme is developed. The synchronizer
	is mainly made up of correlator, angle calculator and peak detector,
	which are implemented by an iterative process, a CORDIC circuit and
	a finite state machine, respectively. Such an architecture results
	in low implementation complexity and low computational latency.},

	with frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) UWB systems. The scheme
	is based on a newly designed preamble for both coarse timing and
	the subsequent channel estimation. Despite of the presence of coarse
	timing error, the estimated channel impulse response (CIR) is simply
	the cyclic shifted version of the real CIR, thanks to the unique
	structure of the preamble. The coarse timing error (CTE) is then
	determined from the CIR estimation and used to fine tune the timing
	position and the frequency domain equalization coefficients. The
	proposed scheme saves preamble overhead by performing joint synchronization
	and channel estimation, and outperforms existing timing acquisition
	methods in the literature in dense multipath UWB channels. In addition,
	the impact of timing error on channel estimation and the performance
	of SC-FDE UWB systems are analyzed, and the bit-error-rate (BER)
	degradation with respect to a certain timing error is derived.},
